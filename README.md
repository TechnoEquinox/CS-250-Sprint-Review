# CS-250-Sprint-Review

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle at Southern New Hampshire University.


1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves understanding the requirements and expectations for the end-users or stakeholders. Creating user stories helps to break down complex requirements into managable tasks that focus on the user's goals. These stories can give developers a more user centric approach which helps to maintain a clear perspective on what is important to the end-user. By translating needs into specific actions and acceptance criteria, developers can ensure that each program feature aligns with user expectations.

2) How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing software, I usually start by planning out the requirements and systems that will be needed to create the end product. Once I have a general understanding of what needs to be done, I will then begin implementing the major parts of a software project, usually creating the back-end core system as the backbone of the project. At this point, I can then reevaluate what is working already and what I got wrong in my planning and needs to be rethought. The Agile process encourages adaptive planning and incremental progress, which are practices I find essential for staying aligned with a project's goal. In future work, I look forward to taking part in daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives to add value to my team. 


3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team's goals while supporting the roles and contributions of others. Good team members communicate openly, share knowledge, and collaborate to overcome challenges. They are also receptive to feedback and willing to help others, which creates a positive and productive environment. Practicing accountability is crucial, as it builds trust within the team and ensures everyone is working toward the same objective. Effective team members help to create a culture of learning and mutual respect, which is important for successful projects and professional growth.
